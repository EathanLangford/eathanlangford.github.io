                    <p>
                        Before tech, my passion was solely creativity, with a decade in the arts industry working as a Graphic Designer and Tattoo
                        Artist.
                        My interests include Movies, Comic books, Technology, Video-games and Art.
                        I began my journey into technology to build software that can help people and contribute to the amazing open source community.

                    <!-- I am an artist by trade and been involved in the arts industry for over a decade. </br></br>
                I have a background in Design, working as a qualified Graphic Designer and then working the last 8 years as a Tattoo Artist.
                </br>
                My hobbies include; Video Games, Drawing, Painting. Cooking and Aquarium care. </br>
                Technology has always been a big hobby of mine. </br>
                I began tinkering with computers with my dad from a young age. </br>
                I want to become a Developer to help bring these two parts together, as I find writing code to be another creative outlet
                for people. </br>
                The qualities that attract me to businesses is the desire to keep employees happy by creating a supportive and inviting work
                environment. </br>
                I find satisfaction in my work when you can sit back and dissect a problem. Dealing with it like a puzzle and you’re creating
                the pieces. </br>
                I would be an asset as work best in teams. </br>
                I am a people person, I am easy-going and easy to get along with. </br>
