 # Website

 ## Purpose
 ---
 The purpose of my website is to be an online folio representation of myself.
## Functionality / features
---
My website is designed to be a single page, with a scrolling effect to cover all the information. It contains these features:

+ A logo that represents my love for retro-futuristic styles, video games and the era it represents.
+ An about section that describes my interests and previous work.
+ A skills section that showcases the technology skills we will have under our belt after the Coder Academy Bootcamp.
+ Contact section where people can contact me by submitting a form with their name, email and message.

## Sitemap
---
I didn't need to include a sitemap, as it isn't necessary being a single page website.

### MOBILE VERSION: 
(didnt quite scroll shot properly)

# Target Audience
My intended target audience is my prospective employers and others in the industry. Im also appealing the current trend of nostalgia in society.

# Tech Stack
I built the cite using html and css. I chose to host through Github Pages over Netlify. It deploys every time i update the repo.

# Design Documentation
I began my process by gathering inspiration on pintrest. I focussed in on my interest in video games. I combined it with my interest in retro futuristic colour themes of pink and blue.

### PINTEREST BOARD

I Then started with a few sketches as ideas started to form from my boad.

I then explored some colour palette options with font choices.

Here are my wireframes. The idea stayed pretty consistant so i worked on the graphics i was going to use first.

# Logo
I wanted to stick to the 80's retro futuristic vibe with my logo. I wanted a title like a video game would. This one i had actually had prepared already.

# Usability Considerations
I decided to not include a menu to aid in the scrolling effect.   
Approaching the colours was difficult as the contrast ration was thrown out. So i tried to contrast lighter shades with darker shades to make it more readable. 
I made my site responsive.

# QUESTIONS
#### Key Events from 1980-Today.
There was many advancements during the 80's that really set up the foudations of what our experience with the internet is today. In 81, 3Com began selling ethernet products. Allowing for LAN networks. In 82, the first commercial network, Telenet was established. in 85, the first ever domain symbolics.com was established. The following decade saw an increase in the rate in which technology was advancing. In 1990, CERN developed HTML and URL giving us the World Wide Web. 1n 95, Windows 95 was released and Java was created. Google was established in 1998, and in 99 we got our first virus. In the 2000's google rose to dominate the search engine market. This decade also saw the creation of Wi-fi and smartphones. In 2005 the first ever cat video was uploaded.

### Fundamental Aspects of the Internet

Computers connected to the internet, are called clients and servers. 
Clients are the web user's internet enabled device. Servers are the computers that store all the information for you to access. When a clients device puts in a request for a site, the server then copies a version onto the clients machine.
Domains are a string that represents the numerical IP address of the server. Web browsers are an interface that gives us a simpler way to view all these interactions.

### Reflection on the development of LAN.

Norman Abramson lead a team of researchers at the University of Hawaii. With ARPA funding they set out to provide remote access to their main computer system but rather than use telephone lines, they used a shared radio network. This could've presented problems when more than one station attempted to transmit at the same time, they would interfere with eachother. Cancelling eachother out.
The protocols developed for this system Aloha, initiated the project Ethernet. 
Ethernet was developed by a group lead by Robert Metcalfe at Xerox's PARC(Palo Alto Research Center). The experiment showed that using coaxial cables resulted in an efficient network. Unlike the problems presented in Aloha, Ethernet stations could detect collisions and would stagger the transmission of data. This made the idea practical for use. Shared-media LAN's became the dominant way for communication between computers in a local site, like a building. This spawned variations from IBM and others who all captured a part of the emerging market.
